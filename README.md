<h1>War Card Game</h1>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
<p>This is a very simple card game that most of us know as "War". Two or more cards are compared. The player who places the highest card wins all lower cards. Acquiring all cards wins the game (I discovered that most 1-on-1 games usually result in an infinite loops and cannot be won). The top left-most card was intended to be the human player, but since there is little more involvement than clicking the card, I decided not to make a big deal about identifying players.</p>
<p>My purpose in making this game was to study and apply coding architecture techniques. This project is a preamble to other projects I intend work on and  helped me to figure out what kind of code organization works and what does not. After playing the game, you may agree that the settings menu is more fun than the game itself, but making a fun game was not the point. Now that I know how things work, I can move forward and make card games and other genres of games that are actually fun to play while not spending so much time figuring out the logistics and mechanics of the framework. I made an effort to code as cleanly as possible and will admit that this project is a good representation of what anyone can expect of me as a software engineer.</p>

<b>DEPENDENCIES:</b>
<ul><li>C++ 11</li>
    <li>SFML (Get it here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)</li></ul>

<b>RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:</b>
    <p>There is a file in this repository called "War.zip" that contains an .exe for Windows and an .out for Linux. Just download, unzip, and run.
    If running in Windows, you will likely get virus warnings when trying to open the .exe file ("Oh no! exe bad! Time to panic!"). Just ignore it. Not a virus.</p>

<b>COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS (CMake):</b>
<ol><li>Create "Build" folder in the code directory</li>
    <li>Change directory into the "Build" folder</li>
    <li>Run command: '<b>cmake ..</b>' (auto configure) or '<b>ccmake ..</b>' (for manual configuring)<br> 
    	If manual, configure anything needed but you should only need to add "Debug" to the blank line.
        Enter "c" to create a cmakeList.txt file. Enter "g" to finish generating and exit the gui.</li>
    <li>After the cmake files have been generated in the "Build" folder, run the command: '<b>make</b>'. 
        This will create a "Main.out" executable file in the source folder.</li>
    <p>*Note: Only step 4 will be needed for repeat compiles once the Build folder is created and 
        initialized. There are also scripts to assist with compiling and cleaning garbadge files.</p></ol>

<b>COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS (g++):</b>
    <ul><li>If CMake isnt working, you can use the 'compileAndRun.bash' script. Just run as is.</li></ul>

<b>OTHER:</b>
    <p>The above compile instructions are for Linux. Compiling in Windows may be difficult because Visual C++ does not contain libraries that I used like "dirent".
    I actually had to copy this library from the internet and place it in my code as a custom library to get it to work. Additionally, Visual C++ is picky about 
    some syntax that g++ ignores and gives you errors for. It took quite a bit of work, but I managed to cross-compile in windows and provide the .exe in the "War.zip"
    file. If you just want to play the game and are using Windows, save yourself the headache and just use my provided file.</p>
